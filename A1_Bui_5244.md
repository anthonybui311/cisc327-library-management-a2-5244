Other than that, R1 meet the requirements
- Title (required, max 200 characters)
- Author (required, max 100 characters)
- Total copies (required, positive integer)
- The system shall display success/error messages and redirect to the catalog view after successful addition.

R2: I check R2 manually through the UI. It meets all the requirement as I see it in the UI, contains all 
- Book ID, Title, Author, ISBN
- Available copies / Total copies
- Actions (Borrow button for available books)

R3: Meets all the requirement in the requirements_specification. 

- Accepts patron ID and book ID as the form parameters
- Validates patron ID (6-digit format)
- Checks book availability and patron borrowing limits (max 5 books)
- Creates borrowing record and updates available copies
- Displays appropriate success/error messages


R4, R5, R6, R7 was not implement yet

## Test Script Summary

**R1 - Add Book Tests (13 test cases):**
- Valid inputs with different scenarios
- Empty/whitespace title and author validation
- Title length limit (200 chars) and author length limit (100 chars)  
- ISBN validation for length (must be exactly 13 digits) and numeric format
- Zero copies validation and duplicate ISBN checking

**R2 - Display Catalog (Manually Check):**
- Contains Book id, title, author and ISBN 
- Available copies / Total copies
- Actions (Borrow button for available books)

**R3 - Borrow Book Tests (8 test cases):**
- Valid borrowing with proper due date calculation
- Patron ID validation (exactly 6 digits, numeric only)
- Book availability checking and non-existent book handling
- Maximum borrowing limit enforcement (5 books per patron)
- Database record creation and availability updates

**R4, R5, R6, R7 - Placeholder Tests:**
Since these functions aren't implemented yet, I created basic tests that check they return the expected "not implemented" responses. This way when we do implement them later, we can easily expand these test cases.

The test setup automatically creates a fresh database for each test with sample data, so all tests run independently without interfering with each other. I used proper assertions to check both success/failure status and specific error messages to make sure the validation logic works correctly.

## Table

| Function Name | Implementation Status | What is Missing (if any) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| R1 - Add Book To Catalog | Partial | • ISBN validation fails when ISBN contains letters<br>• Requirement specifies exactly 13 digits<br>• All other features working: title validation (max 200), author validation (max 100), total copies validation, success/error messages, redirect functionality |
| R2 - Catalog Display | Complete | None - all requirements met including Book ID, Title, Author, ISBN display, available/total copies display, and borrow button for available books |

- **4 functions are not implemented** (R4, R5, R6, R7)
